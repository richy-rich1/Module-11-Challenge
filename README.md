Challenge 11 "Data Analysis on Mars"

dives into Mars' weather patterns by focusing on minimum temperatures and atmospheric pressure recorded by the Curiosity Rover. This project aims to uncover climate trends on the Red Planet, such as seasonal shifts and extreme conditions, through data collection, monthly analyses, and insightful visualizations. Using web scraping, we gather the latest Mars data from reliable news sources, then analyze the lowest air pressure and temperature readings monthly, highlighting recurring patterns or anomalies. Visualizations bring these findings to life, making it easy to spot trends, and all data can be exported to a CSV file for further study. This project is powered by Python technologies like Pandas for data handling, Matplotlib for plotting, and web scraping tools like Splinter and BeautifulSoup.

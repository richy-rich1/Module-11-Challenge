Challenge 11 "Data Analysis on Mars"
explores the weather patterns of Mars by concentrating on the Curiosity Rover's measurements of minimum temperatures and atmospheric pressure. Through data collecting, monthly analysis, and perceptive visualizations, this project seeks to identify climatic patterns on the Red Planet, including seasonal variations and extreme situations. We get the most recent Mars data from reputable news sources using web scraping, and then we examine the monthly lowest temperature and air pressure readings to identify any trends or abnormalities. All data may be saved to a CSV file for additional research, and visualizations make these discoveries come to life and make it simple to identify trends. Python technologies such as Matplotlib for plotting, Splinter and BeautifulSoup for site scraping, and Pandas for data management power this project.
